lv INTRODUCTION.

frailiy should be secretly shown to the priest (voluit Deus quod
occulte ostendatur infirmitas sacerdoti p. 301). Yet other sermons
contain passages in which he speaks with evident contempt of
auricular confession, calling it (ns in the third volume) a human
invention and a notorious fraud, taking its tise from lnnocent 111.¹
There are, he says, two kinds of confession, one before God, the
other before rnen, and the latter is an invention of men. Only
confession to God is necessary to salvation. And in another sermon
(pp. 55—57) he exposes the abusos connected with auricular con-
fession² which ought on their account to be abolished. Here we have
clearly u direct contradiction.

In Sermon xxxul Wyclif speaks (p. 289) of the merit of sasting
(de bono ieiunio); in anorher sermon he makes light of sasting. The
greetl ol= the priests, he says (p. 55) orders sasting,³ Christ nnd the
apostles did not set much store by it.⁴

Equally contradictory is his teaching about purgatory,

Whilst he says in the LV¹¹¹ sermon that the greatest work of
chnriry that can be shown to a dead man is to shorten his suffering
in purgatory (p. 433); whilst in the sume sermon he speaks os those
who are burnt in Hell according to the sins which they have
committed (p. 432); in the second sermon he makes light of prayers
for the dead, :ind sets forth a doctrine which was accepted and
perfected by the Taburites, who, as is well known, rejected purgatory.⁵

Finally, WycliPs utterences about merit before God are also in
contradiction ιο his langunge about the Praesciti — i. e. the reprobate,

‘Ideo absit Deum iustum er rucionnbileni qui non potest nisi graciose er
levite·- hominem onerum, requirere simpliciter nti dandonem pet-:mi vel nssismncinm
sacer-lotis terreni vel vocalem fnrmneionem loquele. lit ist· confessio ati Deum

quare iste partes penitencie ex intencione infectu communiter mucul-ntur. ⁴ Et idco
Christus et sui apostoli ule opus misericordie nichil aut modicum attendebant.
