condemned frorn all eternity — a contradiction to which a scribe nf
the 15¹¹¹ century called attention.

To what must we attribute all these contradictions} The present
collection is not, like each of the first three parts, a piece of one
tasting, but consists of two distinct parts, which differ very much in
their subject and extenti

The larger of these two collection-is of sermons was composed
before Wyclif broke into open antagonism to the ruling Church, “dum
stetit in scolis”, consequently before he had anained the degree of D. D.

These sermons, 40 in number (Sermones Quadraginta), hegin
with N⁰ XXIII, and are written essentially in the spirit of the
prevailing hierarchyt So much is this the case that a scribe ol the
15¹¹· century could not suppress the remark that “the Wyclif of these
sermons was quite another man than was to be found in the remaining
works; fory except in a few passages, his teaching perfectly corresponds
with that of the Church.’'¹

In these few words the general character of these 40 Sermons
is correctly described. What is said of the exceptions also hits the
mark, and we have only to enquire to what period these exceptions
belong,

Before we can solve this question, we must examine more
closely the other sermons of the fourth part, which form the section
of the XXIV Sermones Mixri, and are called in the MSS. Set-mones XX
in fine vitae suae.

They belong then, as a whole, to the last years of Wyclis‘s lise,
and bear an altogether different stari-up from the Sermones quadraginta. ’

Here the war against the prevailing abuses of the Church takes
the first place. Wyclif demands that the Church should be restored
to its “apostolic'’ state, according to which the clergy are bound to
live in poverty like Christ and his apostles.

The tithes they receive are mere altus, and ought to be with-
drawn from wicked priests.² The King has the right to confiscate
