11. The Manuseripts.

As the present collection is composed of two main groups of
sermons, the Sermones mixti and the Quadraginta Sermones (dum
stetit in scolis). we must distinguish several groups of MSS, First, those
containing all the sermons; secondly, MSS. in which only the Sermones
Mixti are to he iound; thirdly, others having the Quadraginta Serrnones3
fourthly and finally, those containing only single sermons. To the
first group belongs the Codex B, 16, 2 of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge (Αι, described in the first volume os the Sermones (pp. XXXV
to xxxx'll'r. to the second group belong the two MSS. of the Vienna
Imperial Libmry N‘· 3928 (D) and N⁰ 3931 (E) also mentioned in the
first volume (pp. xxxvnl—XXXIXN.

The Sermones Quadraginta are in the Codd. pal. Vindob. 3928
and 393² (G), :ind in the Cod. Lambeth 23 (Η). The Coit. pal.
Vind. 3932 (G), has been already susficiently described by Lechler in
his edition of the Trialogus (pp. 24Ἁ26). The Codex 3928 contains
both the Sermones Mixti and the Quadraginta Sermones; yet it cannot
be recltoned in our first group, since both divisions are not written
by the same hand, nor do they follow immediately one upon another.

To the last group finally belong the Codex os Trinity College,
Dublin, C, 1 23 (F) tsee De Ecclesia, pp. xxn and xxm, and
Sermones 111¹* volume, p. 4), the Cod. lIl G ιι (Ι) of the Prague
University Library, the Codd. 3929 (K) and 1337 (L) of the Viemia
Imperial Library· (cf. VVycl. Pol. Vl'orks ed. Buddensieg, pag. XXIX and
pag. XL). As all these MSS. except Η und l have been described at
large, some remarks on these two Codices may suffice.

H is a volume belonging to the librat-y os the Archbishop of
Cnnterbury at Lamberh, N⁰ 23. it is on vellum ¹57² inches high,
ιι inches broad, and rather more than 2 inches thick. Ench page
has two columns ιι“’Ξ >< ’,ἥ-Ἰ, hebes, containing about 68 lines. lt
is well and clearly written in a hand οἱ about 1400. There is nn
illuminated letter and flourish nt the beginning ol* each treuna, and
the initial letter of each serrnon is slightly adorned. Alternate red
and blue paragraph marks are distributed somewhat capriciously. The
leather binding is stamped with the arms of urchbishop Bancroft
(1604—1610), and no doubt belongs to his time. lt retains its clasps.
